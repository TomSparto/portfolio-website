portfolio website for Thinkful


This is a portfolio website that I created for Thinkful. I created this using notepad++ and uploaded these files to GitHub before adding comments to the code. After uploading I used the Github interface to update each file adding comments and adjusting the README that you see here.

Within this website you will find a bit of information about me and some links to learn a little more.

You can view the website that I have created at: https://tomsparto.github.io/portfolio-website/
