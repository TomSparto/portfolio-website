				<h2>Hi, my name is Tom Sparto!</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Playing video games.</li>
					<li>Playing billiards.</li>
					<li>Taking my dog, Bear, for walks.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please take a look at my website and feel free to contact me!</p>

			<h2 class="center space-above">About Tom</h2>
			<p> I worked on learning code a lot when I was in highschool, but never pursued it further after graduating until now.</p>
			<p>I am very happy to be learning with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> now.</p>
			<p class="space-below">If you are looking for a new developer that is ready to learn for any projects, I'm your guy. I'm open and willing to solo projects and group projects alike.</p>
